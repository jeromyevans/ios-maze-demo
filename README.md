# ios-maze-demo
IOS experimentation based on a simple maze game demo at [appcoda](http://www.appcoda.com/ios-game-tutorial-maze-part-1/)

For notes as I wrote it see [the blog](http://localhost:4000/project/2015/01/22/ios-starter.html)

* Sets up a single view application in landscope mode
* Uses Core Motion to animate some UIImageViews (not using SpriteKit)
* Uses CMMotionManager to read acceleration changes and move a UIImageView around
